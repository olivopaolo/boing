 First steps
=============

This tutorial provides few simple examples of the functionality of the
toolkit to help you starting to use the |boing| toolkit.

Let's consider to have a multi-touch input device, like a tablet or a
touch-screen. What cool things can I do with |boing|? |boing| enables to
create a pipeline for connecting your device to different targets,
like applications, frameworks, debuggers and eventually processing the
gesture events before having being dispatched, like for example
calibrate the contacts' position or apply a smoothing filter.

To make things easier, let's consider that your device can send the
information of the contact events as a TUIO stream on the local
port 3333. [#]_


Showing multi-touch events
==========================

First of all, it is important to know that all the |boing|'s tools are
invoked by using the script :command:`boing`. Open a terminal and
type::

   boing "in.tuio: + viz:"

The script should have opened a window displaying a grid. Now when you
touch your multi-touch device, you will be able to see the contact
points appear on the window.

It's not difficult to notice that the script accepts a single argument
that defines the configuration of the pipeline that is to be
created. Configurations are defined by a formula where the operands
define the functionality of the nodes of the pipeline, while the
operators define how the nodes are connected, therefore also the
structure of the pipeline. [#]_

In the previous example, the pipeline was composed by two nodes:

- :code:`in.tuio:` corresponds to a node that reads the socket,
  decodes the TUIO stream and provides the multi-touch events;
- :code:`viz:` corresponds to the *Contact Visualizer*, a widget
  that shows the information of the contact points, such as position,
  track and speed.

The two nodes are joined using the :code:`+` operator, which stands
for connection *in series*. The structure of the pipeline is
represented in :ref:`figure 3.1 <figure1>`.

Congratulations! You have created your first |boing| pipeline!

Exploring the data
==================

Now, let's try new functionalities by adding a new node. Stop the
previous pipeline by closing the visualizer widget or pressing Ctrl-C
on the terminal, and type in the terminal::

  boing "in.tuio: + (viz: | dump:)"

As before the contact visualizer appears again, but this time, when
you touch the multi-touch device, the terminal prints a lot of data!
The terminal output represents all the data that the :code:`in.tuio:`
node can produce and send to the connected nodes. This tutorial is not
aimed to provide an exaustive description of the message structure;
for the moment, simply observe that data messages are hierarchical
structures mainly composed by Python built-in types, such as
dictionaries, lists, strings, bytearrays, etc. Thanks to such standard
structure, |boing| exploits a query language, similar to JSONPath_,
for the indexing or the filtering of data messages. In order to
understand the usefulness of such query language, stop the pipeline
and type in the terminal::

  boing "in.tuio: + (viz: | dump:?request=$..contacts)"

Now, when you touch your multi-touch device, you can see that the
terminal prints the subset of the data structures that refers only to
the contact data. This is because the query :code:`$..contacts`
addresses to any data named as :code:`contacts`, searched at any level
of the structure. Such query language can be very useful during
development and testing phases for highlighting only the relevant
information.

A more exhaustive description of the data structure and of the query
language can be found in the :doc:`data model <datamodel>` section. For
now, let's leave the data structure and we consider the functioning of
the pipeline: it's not difficult to understand that the :code:`|`
operator (*Pipe*) is used to connect in parallel the nodes :code:`viz:` and
:code:`dump:`, so that the products are sent to both of
them. :ref:`Figure 3.2 <figure2>` shows the structure of the current
pipeline.

Combining input sources with external applications
==================================================


A key feature of |boing| is the ability to provide the captured input
events to external applications. This enables in most of the cases to
take advantage of the toolkit's features without the need to adapt or
to modify the applications, while sometimes a simple configuration may
be required. As shown in :ref:`figure 3.3 <figure3>`, the Boing
toolkit works as a semi-transparent layer placed between the input
sources and the final applications.

      Boing works as a semi-transparent layer placed in between the
      devices and the applications for processing and transmitting the
      input events.

Thanks to the many supported encodings, |boing| can easily fit different
combinations of devices and applications. In this basic example, let's
consider to have an application listening for a TUIO stream on the
local port 3335 [#]_. If you don't have a TUIO application, simply open a
new terminal and launch a new |boing| instance using the command::

   boing "in.tuio://:3335 + viz:"

In the previous example you connected one input device to two output
nodes. The :code:`|` operator also enables to put in parallel
different inputs, like for example a second multi-touch device enabled
to send its TUIO messages to the local port 3334. Let's try a new
pipeline by running the command::

   boing "(in.tuio: | in.tuio://:3334) + (viz: | out.tuio://[::1]:3335)"

Note that for the first input it has not been necessary to define the
port number, since the default port for the TUIO protocol is
the 3333. For the second one instead the port number has been defined
to 3334. :ref:`Figure 3.4 <figure4>` shows the structure of the new
pipeline.

As you can see, a very important feature of |boing| is that you can
simultaneously connect many devices to different applications. Such
feature eases the usage of debugging tools and it enables multi-device
and multi-user applications.

Data processing
===============

The |boing| toolkit is not only able to redirect input data to
different destinations, but it also enables to process the transferred
data. With regard to the multi-touch devices, recurring operations are
the removal of the sensor noise and the calibration of the touch
points. In order to accomplish these tasks, the toolkit provides
two functional nodes that can be easily employed in our
pipelines. As an example, let's run a new pipeline using the following
command::

   boing "in.tuio: + filtering: + calib:?screen=left + viz:"

Now, when you touch your tactile device you should still see the
interactions on the visualizer widget, but now they look more smooth
and they are rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. By employing the
:code:`filtering:` node, we added the default smoothing filter, which
is applied by default to the position of the contact points, while the
node :code:`calib:` performs the calibration of the touch points [#]_.

The structure of the current pipeline is shown in :ref:`figure 3.5 <figure5>`.

.. _figure5:

   .. figure:: images/firststeps5.pdf
      :align: center

      Pipeline obtained from the configuration :code:`in.tuio: +
      filtering: + calib:?screen=left + viz:`

In order to better understand the result of the processing stage, it
may be useful to show at the same time the raw data and the processed
one. In order to achieve such result, stop the previous pipeline and
run the following command::

   boing "in.tuio: + (filtering: + calib:?screen=left + edit:?source=filtered | nop:) + viz:"

Now, when you touch your input device you can see on the visualizer
widget both the raw tracks and the processed tracks, so that it is
easier to note the effect of the processing stage. The structure of
the modified pipeline is shown in :ref:`figure 3.6 <figure6>`. Note
that this behaviour has been obtained by adding a parallel branch
constituted only by the node :code:`nop:`, which simply forwards the
incoming data without making any modifications, and adding the node
:code:`edit:?source=filtered`, which labels the events of the
processing branch so that they belong to the source *filtered* (the
name is not relevant). This latter step is necessary since the data of
the two parallel branches is merged into a single stream before being
passed to the visualizer widget.
