Boing |release| documentation
=============================

Welcome! This is the documentation for Boing |release|, last updated |today|.

Boing is a toolkit to support the development and the evaluation of
gesture enabled applications.

Boing enables to connect several input
sources to target destinations (e.g. applications, log files, etc.)
and eventually process the data before being dispatched. In order to
do so, Boing creates a pipeline of processing nodes, where there are
nodes that read the sources, others that write to the destinations and
in the middle there can be nodes that process the data.
