    The Request class implements the Composite design

    request and only if the match is valid it triggers the consumer.

    producers for receiving their products. When a producer posts a
    product, it triggers the registered consumers; the triggered
    consumers will immediately or at regular time interval demand the
    producer the new products.

    Many consumers can be subscribed to a single producer. Each new
    product is actually shared within the different consumers,
    therefore a consumer SHOULD NOT modify any received product,
    unless it is supposed to be the only consumer.

    Consumers have a request. When a producer is demanded to posts a
    product, it tests the product with the consumer's request and only
    if the match is valid it triggers the consumer.

    A consumer's request must be an instance of the class Request. The
    requests 'Request.NONE' and "Request.ANY" are available for
    selecting none or any product.
